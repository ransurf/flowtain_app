# Flowtain
## Information
Flowtain is a mobile app developed in Android Studio using Kotlin. It was created with the purpose to incentivize productivity through user-created rewards.
### Inspiration
COVID-19 has negatively impacted society, which has resulted in the loss in motivation for some people due to their depressing circumstances; for example, many of my friends have been neglecting their studies, and have simply resorted to playing games and endlessly consuming social media. Fortunately, my app provides a tool to help practice self-discipline, motivating people to do work before being rewarded. Through my app, I hope I can provide a foundation for people to work towards their aspirations and goals in life.
### Name
Flowtain is a mix of the words “flow” and “fountain”, which help convey the purpose of the app. By incentivizing time spent doing meaningful work, I hope the users of the app can develop a sense of flow state to help them productively perform their tasks. Then, just like a fountain’s continuous stream, one’s efforts will be rewarded through their chosen rewards, and they will  feel motivated to continue the cycle.
### Features
#### Points Fragment
The points page displays the user’s current points, a list of user-created rewards, and an interface to create rewards (two input fields and a button). Toasts will display when a player has claimed a reward, or when a player does not have enough points to claim a reward.
#### Timer Fragment
The timer page displays the time left on the timer, as well as a circular progress bar to visually represent the user’s progress towards their set timer. There are three buttons underneath to start, pause, and stop the timer. The user will gain a point for the amount of full minutes elapsed when running the timer (59 seconds elapsed will equate to 0 points), and this update of points will occur when the user stops the timer or when the timer finishes.
#### Settings Fragment
The settings page allows the user to adjust the length of the timer in minutes.
#### Interactive Status Bar
When outside of the timer page, the user can alter the state of the timer through the status bar in the phone’s notification tab.
